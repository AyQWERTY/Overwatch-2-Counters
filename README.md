# Owerwatch 2 Counters

*This is a very dumb project with counterpics of various characters in Overwatch 2. The data is taken from videos from the Anak channel.
Everything here is done manually, without using any scripts or json data files. That's why the project is as dumb as possible, but you can quickly see which hero is better to take.*

## What's inside?
**There are two pages inside:**
- **Home page**: here you will find 3 counterpics for the different classes for each hero
- **Stats**: here you can find information about how often a character was a counterpick ~~*(quality index lmao)*~~
